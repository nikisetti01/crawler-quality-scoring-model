## üéØ Research Motivation and Objectives
Web crawling is a cornerstone of modern search engines. Classical frontier prioritisation strategies (e.g., PageRank) rely on **global graph analysis**, which is computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time crawling.  
This thesis proposes a paradigm shift: **semantic-aware frontier prioritisation** based on transformer models enriched with metadata.  
The main contributions are:
- Moving from **page-centric quality estimation** to **outlink utility prediction**.  
- Designing and fine-tuning **LLM-based models** for binary classification and score estimation.  
- Extending models with **metadata fusion** (anchors, domains, numeric link features).  
- Integrating predictions into a **crawler simulation framework** and benchmarking against BFS, DFS, and PageRank.

## ‚ùì Research Questions
The repository addresses the following RQs from the thesis:

- **RQ1**: Can we train effective classifiers that predict whether a page contains semantically relevant outlinks?  
- **RQ2**: Can we produce continuous priority scores suitable for crawler frontier management?  
- **RQ3**: Does metadata integration (anchors, domains, numeric features) improve performance over text-only baselines?  
- **RQ4**: Do these models, once integrated into a real crawling pipeline, outperform classical baselines such as PageRank in practice?
